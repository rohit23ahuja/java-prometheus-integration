I am developer in a batch based application that has multiple batch jobs, the application is built using java language. my application is packaged as jar application and every time i need to execute these batch jobs i execute this jar. These batch jobs run daily. Only if some error occurs or manual intervention needed, we manually re-execute one or more of these batch jobs but this is not often. Most of the times only 1 job runs but some times i execute my jar parallely to execute jobs that can be run concurrently. I want to plot below information about these jobs in grafana :-
1. percentage of batch jobs completed today
2. percentage of batch jobs failed today
3. percentage of batch jobs running now
4. percentage of patricular type of batch jobs completed today (lets batch jobs having string "petrol" in job name)
5. start time and end time of today's batch
6. start time and end time of each job
7. status of each job - three statuses i want to track - running, completed or failed
8. duration of each batch job - for how long it ran

my application pushes metrics to prometheus push gateway. prometheus server then scrapes metrics from it. use prometheus query i want to plot the data. tell me what kind of meters i should create in my application to achieve this. give me an efficient. i will use prometheus pushgateway java client
